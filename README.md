# Tutorial

Using ATCRecall, you can set up to 3 timers. In order to do so, fill the 3 fields with the timer duration, the callsign f the aircraft and the reason you put the timer, for example:

Once you have filled the fields, press the '+' button, it will start to run the timer...

When the timer reaches 00:00, it will display END in red, and play a little sound to get your attention:

You can delete any timer at any time by simply pressing the X button next to it

NB: When you delete a timer, the others won't move to fill the hole let by the former timer, that's a normal behaviour and it may be corrected in further updates.
